NAME
====

silently - prevent any output from a block

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use silently;
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

silently is module that exports a single sub called `silently` that takes a block to execute. Inside that block, all textual output to `$*OUT` and `$*ERR` is prevented from actually being sent to STDOUT and STDERR.

Note that if you're only interested in surpressing output from warnings, you should use the `quietly` statement prefix.

SUBROUTINES
===========

silently
--------

```raku
silently { say "hello world" }  # no output

my $captured = silently { note "tis wrong" }
if $captured.err -> $error {
  say "something went wrong: $error";
}
```

The `silently` subroutine takes a block as a parameter, and runs that block catching all output to `$*OUT` and `$*ERR`.

If the output is actually needed for inspection: the subroutine returns an object that provides two methods: `out` and `err`, giving the captured output to `$*OUT` and `$*ERR` respectively.
